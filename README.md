# Xvis
Computer vision for X-ray testing

Xvis is the Matlab Toolbox of the book Computer Vision for X-ray Testing by Domingo Mery. In this book we use many commands of Xvis, i.e. a Matlab Toolbox that we developed for X-ray testing with computer vision. Xvis Tolbox contains approximately 150 functions for image processing, feature extraction, feature transformation, feature analysis, feature selection, data selection and generation, classification, clustering, performance evaluation, multiple-view analysis, image sequence processing and tracking with geometrical constraints. 

Commands of Xvis starts with letter 'X'. For example Ximmedian corresponds to the implemented function of Xvis for median filtering. Each function of Xvis has a 'help' with one or more examples.

In addition, Xvis Toolbox includes a general framework that designs a computer vision system automatically in few lines code, or using two powerful graphic user interfaces one for feature extraction and for feature and classifier selection. It finds the features and the classifiers for a given visual task avoiding the classical trial and error framework commonly used by human designers.
